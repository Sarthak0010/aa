Great question—and yes, you're absolutely right to think about whether this can be done **within the main table** using a **new calculated column** rather than creating separate summary tables.

### ✅ Short Answer:
Yes! You **can do this in your main table** using **calculated columns and DAX measures**. This might be easier for beginners and makes visuals simpler to manage.

---

## ✅ OPTION: Do It ALL in the Main Table Using Calculated Column + Measure

Here’s how to go about it **step-by-step** using your main table (let’s assume it’s called `'AttendanceData'`).

---

### 🔹 STEP 1: Filter Only Relevant Records (No action required now)
You don’t need to filter in Power Query—just make sure your DAX uses only relevant rows:
- `Regularization Status` = **"No"** or **"Regularization Needed"**
- `Date` is between **1st and 15th April 2025**

We'll handle this using measures or visual-level filters.

---

### 🔹 STEP 2: Create a Measure to Count Regularizations Per Employee Number

Go to **Modeling → New Measure**, and enter this DAX:

```DAX
RegularizationCount = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('AttendanceData'),
    FILTER(
        'AttendanceData',
        'AttendanceData'[Regularization Status] IN {"No", "Regularization Needed"}
            && 'AttendanceData'[Date] >= DATE(2025, 4, 1)
            && 'AttendanceData'[Date] <= DATE(2025, 4, 15)
    )
)
```

But this gives total count for all employees. So instead:

---

### 🔹 STEP 3: Create a **New Calculated Column** to Count Regularizations Per Employee

Go to **Modeling → New Column** and use:

```DAX
EmployeeRegularizationCount = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('AttendanceData'),
    FILTER(
        'AttendanceData',
        'AttendanceData'[Regularization Status] IN {"No", "Regularization Needed"}
            && 'AttendanceData'[Employee Number] = EARLIER('AttendanceData'[Employee Number])
            && 'AttendanceData'[Date] >= DATE(2025, 4, 1)
            && 'AttendanceData'[Date] <= DATE(2025, 4, 15)
    )
)
```

🔁 This column will show for **each row** how many regularization entries that employee had during the date range.

---

### 🔹 STEP 4: Use This in Visuals with a Filter

For all visuals:
- Add a **visual-level filter**:
  ```text
  EmployeeRegularizationCount > 3
  ```

## 📊 Visual Ideas with This Column

| Visual Type       | Fields Used |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Bar Chart**     | Axis: `Employee Number`, Value: `EmployeeRegularizationCount` |
| **Donut Chart**   | Legend: `Department`, Value: `EmployeeRegularizationCount` |
| **Table**         | Columns: `Employee Number`, `Department`, `EmployeeRegularizationCount` |
| **Trend Chart**   | Axis: `Date`, Value: `Count of Employee Number`, Filter: Regularization Status IN "No", "Regularization Needed" |

---

## 🔄 Pros of This Approach
✅ Simple  
✅ No need to manage extra tables  
✅ Works well with slicers  
✅ Easy to debug and visualize  

---

Would you like me to write more visuals, do a layout suggestion, or help you build DAX to show **top 5 employees** with most regularizations?



Perfect! Using **Employee Number** instead of Employee Name is a great idea—especially for unique identification and grouping. Let’s update everything **step by step** using **Employee Number** as the key.

## 🧾 UPDATED STEP-BY-STEP POWER BI DASHBOARD: Regularization Analysis by Employee Number (1–15 April 2025)

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Load Data into Power BI
Same as before:
- Click **Home → Get Data** → Load your Excel or CSV file.
- Make sure it has:
  - `Employee Number` ✅
  - `Regularization Status`
  - `Date`
  - (Optional: `Department`, `Employee Name`, etc.)

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Filter Date Range (1st to 15th April 2025)
1. Click **Home → Transform Data**.
2. In **Power Query Editor**, filter the `Date` column:
   - Right-click → **Date Filters → Between**
   - Set **Start = 1/4/2025**, **End = 15/4/2025**
3. Click **Close & Apply**.

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Keep Only Relevant Regularization Categories

Filter rows where:
- `Regularization Status` is **"No"** or **"Regularization Needed"**.

You can either:
- Filter this in Power Query, or
- Do it directly in DAX when summarizing (which is cleaner).

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Create Summary Table by Employee Number

Go to:
- **Modeling → New Table**

Paste this DAX (updated to use **Employee Number**):

```DAX
EmployeeRegularizationCount = 
SUMMARIZE(
    FILTER(
        'YourTable',
        'YourTable'[Regularization Status] IN {"No", "Regularization Needed"}
    ),
    'YourTable'[Employee Number],
    'YourTable'[Department],
    "RegularizationCount", COUNTROWS('YourTable')
)
```

> Replace `'YourTable'` with your actual table name.

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Filter Employees with More Than 3 Regularizations

Now, create another new table:

```DAX
FrequentRegularizers = 
FILTER(
    EmployeeRegularizationCount,
    EmployeeRegularizationCount[RegularizationCount] > 3
)
```

---

## ✅ STEP 6: Build Visuals Using Employee Number

### 📊 1. **Bar Chart – Regularizations by Employee Number**
- Visual: **Clustered Bar Chart**
- Axis: `Employee Number`
- Value: `RegularizationCount`
- Filter: `RegularizationCount > 3`

---

### 📊 2. **Donut Chart – By Department**
- Visual: **Donut Chart**
- Values: `RegularizationCount`
- Legend: `Department`
- Filter: `RegularizationCount > 3`

---

### 📊 3. **Table – Employee Details**
- Visual: **Table**
- Columns: `Employee Number`, `Department`, `RegularizationCount`
- Filter: `RegularizationCount > 3`

---

### 📊 4. **Line or Column Chart – Daily Trend**
Use the original table to track how many employees had regularization per day.

- Visual: **Stacked Column Chart**
- Axis: `Date`
- Values: `Count of Employee Number`
- Legend: `Regularization Status` ("No", "Regularization Needed")

---

## ✅ STEP 7: Add Slicers
- Slicer: `Department`
- Slicer: `Date`
- Slicer: `Regularization Status` (optional)

---

## ✅ STEP 8: KPI Card (Optional)

Measure:

```DAX
TotalRegularizations = 
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER(
        'YourTable',
        'YourTable'[Regularization Status] IN {"No", "Regularization Needed"}
    )
)
```

Use this in a **Card visual** titled **"Total Regularization Entries"**.

---

## 🎨 Layout Suggestion (Top-Down)
| Section         | Visual Type            | Data Used |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Top Row        | Slicers (Dept, Date)   | Filters   |
| Left           | Card Visuals (KPIs)    | Count DAX |
| Middle-Left    | Bar Chart              | Employee Number |
| Middle-Right   | Donut (Dept)           | Department |
| Bottom         | Table + Trend Chart    | Detail + Daily |

Would you like me to:
- Create a **mock layout diagram** for you?
- Write all the **final DAX and measures** using your exact table name (if you tell me what it is)?
- Help with **tooltips, formatting, or drill-through**?

Let me know! We can take this to the next level.
