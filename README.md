Project Proposal: Payroll Anomaly Detection using Power BI
1. Introduction
As an intern in the HR department with a background in Big Data Analytics, I propose a project focused on Payroll Anomaly Detection using Power BI. This project will aim to identify and visualize potential anomalies or irregularities in employee payroll data, helping the HR and Finance teams ensure accuracy and compliance.
2. Objective
To analyze payroll data using Power BI and detect anomalies such as irregular net pay, missing deductions, or inconsistent salary components across departments, experience levels, and other employee demographics.
3. Scope
The project will focus on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes salary trends, detects irregular patterns, and supports HR in making informed decisions.
4. Tools & Technologies
• Power BI
• Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning and transformation)
• HR Payroll data (non-sensitive)
5. Dataset Structure
The dataset will include the following columns:
1. Employee_ID – Unique identifier for each employee.
2. Employee_Name – Optional, only if permitted.
3. Gender – For payroll trend analysis across genders.
4. Age – For age group-based payroll analysis.
5. Years_of_Experience – Total years of professional experience.
6. Current_Company_Experience – Years spent in the current organization.
7. Department – For identifying anomalies across departments.
8. Grade/Level – Seniority level for anomaly correlation.
9. Basic_Salary – Mandatory for payroll analysis.
10. Allowances – HRA, medical, or other allowances.
11. Deductions – Loan, tax, or other deductions.
12. Net_Pay – Salary after deductions.
13. Pay_Date – Salary credited date.
14. Salary_Status – Regular, Adjusted, or Anomaly Flag.
15. Payroll_Comments – Notes for any irregular entries.
6. Benefits of the Project
• Detect payroll discrepancies early.
• Improve transparency and trust in payroll processing.
• Help identify systemic issues or data entry errors.
• Enable the HR team to make data-driven decisions.
7. Expected Output
The final output will be a dynamic Power BI dashboard with:
• Salary trend visuals (by department, age group, gender).
• Anomaly flags highlighted using DAX logic.
• Filters for custom views (by grade, experience, etc.).
